running process: testcase_main
testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: testcase_main() will create 3 children, all running XXp1().  They have priority 5, so that they will not interrupt testcase_main().  The PID of each child is stored into a global array.  Then testcase_main() blocks in join() (three times).  The child processes should run in the same order they were created (we use a FIFO for ordering dispatch), and so each can call getpid() to confirm that it has the same value as stored in the global array.

Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to the first XXp1()
running process: XXp1
One of the XXp1() process has started, getpid()=3
This process's getpid() matched what spork() returned.
This XXp1() process will now terminate.
----IN QUIT----
	This is XXp1 quitting
	running process: 3; status = 2
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to the second XXp1()
running process: XXp1
One of the XXp1() process has started, getpid()=4
This process's getpid() matched what spork() returned.
This XXp1() process will now terminate.
----IN QUIT----
	This is XXp1 quitting
	running process: 4; status = 2
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to the second XXp1()
running process: XXp1
One of the XXp1() process has started, getpid()=5
This process's getpid() matched what spork() returned.
This XXp1() process will now terminate.
----IN QUIT----
	This is XXp1 quitting
	running process: 5; status = 2
	I have no previous sibling
----IN JOIN----
	dead child removed from PCB; slot priority: 0
testcase_main: joined with child 5
----IN JOIN----
	dead child removed from PCB; slot priority: 0
testcase_main: joined with child 4
----IN JOIN----
	dead child removed from PCB; slot priority: 0
testcase_main: joined with child 3
Startfunc's retval: 0
Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: testcase_main() returned, simulation will now halt.
finish(): The simulation is now terminating.
