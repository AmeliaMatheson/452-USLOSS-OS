This project was completed as a Operating Systems (CSC 452, University of Arizona) class project with a fellow student.

We created an simple operating system with the USLOSS simulator to imitate real kernel functions such as process scheduling, message communication between processes, concurrency control, and device driver management. This project is broken up into six phases (see folders in main branch). 

Our code is NOT perfect; there are some test cases that we failed. However, this OS project was equal parts challenging and fun to complete. I throughly enjoyed collaborating with
Hudson and learned so much about the inner workings of the OS kernel.
